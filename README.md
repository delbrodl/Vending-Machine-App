# Vending-Machine-App

As the first capstone project at Tech Elevator, I collaborated with a fellow student to develop a console app using the principles of Object Oriented Programming in C#. 

We were asked to develop a application to which employees at a company can purchase items from a virtual vending machine. Employees were able to see a list of all the items available, using File I/O. When a customer selects an item, they are then led through a purchasing menu to feed the application money, complete the transaction, and recieve remaining change.

All purchases were also logged using File I/O. And unit tests were provided to demonstrate code working correctly.

This project helped tie together the concepts learned in the first 4 weeks of the program and put them to practical use.
